<h1>Who is she?</h1>
<section class="little-cute-text">
<p> I am a student at KEA as a Software Developer on second semester.
    Still learning everyday! Besides that I work at IUNO Lawfirm as IT Support.
It is a job I am very grateful for.
<br>
Furthermore, I am just the regular women in her twenties, loving
    spending time with the girlfriends and dreaming to be working with
    IT and software development after finishing school. </p>
